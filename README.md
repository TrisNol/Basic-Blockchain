# Basic Blockchain
This implementation is based on the IBM tutorial at https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/blockchain/tutorials/develop-a-blockchain-application-from-scratch-in-python/
The python backend contains the blockchain itself. Using the Angular frontend transactions can be added and blocks can be mined.

I added some features such as asymetric encryption and digital signatures.
